Events in Javascript : Events are used to trigger a function when an user action happened such as
clicking a button, scrolling a page, typing an input etc..,
Events can be attached to elements in two ways:
i. Event handlers : we use Event handlers in HTML. They are followed by 'on'. They do not have propogation and cannot be removed.
eg : <button onclick = "fun()">click me</button>
if we click the button, it calls fun function in Javascript

ii. Event Listener : we use Event Listeners in JS. They use methods like addEventListener and removeEventListener. They have propogation
eg: <button id="btn">click me</button>
document.getElementById('btn').addEventListener('click',fun);
if we click the button, it calls fun function in Javascript

By default it passes an object to callback function called event object
document.getElementById('btn')
.addEventListener('click',function(e){
    console.log(e)
});
e contains values such as e.target(targeted element - button),
e.key(keyboard pressed value),e.preventDefault(stop default work) etc..,

There are different types of events such as
i. mouse events : Events triggered by mouse
eg: click, dblclick,mouseover,mouseout,mouseup,mousedown,drag,drop etc..,

ii. keyboard events : Events are triggered by keyboard
eg: keyup, keydown etc..,

iii. form events : Events are triggered by form elements like inputs
eg: input,change,select etc.,

iv. window events : events are triggered by overall window 
eg: scroll, load,end etc..,

Event propogation:  Events can be propogated from child to parent or parent to child. This propogation are two types
   i. Bubbling : bottom up approach. by default events follow bubbling
   ii. capturing : top down approach

Event Delegation: it is the design patten or idea of using parent div events instead of indivial child events
document.getElementById('buttons').addEventListener('click', (e) =>
{
    alert(e.target.textContent)
})

we can stop propogation using stopPropogation method
