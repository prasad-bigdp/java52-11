Functions in javascript are blocks of code designed to perform a particular task. They are executed when "called" or "invoked". Functions can take inputs, called parameters, and can return outputs.
   functions are used for
      -- reusable code
      -- divide the code into smaller,logical parts
syntax: function function_name(parameters)
{
    //body
}
function_name(arguments)  //function call

Eg:  create a function display which prints "hello world" in console and call it

Functions parameters need not to have declarations like let,var,const as they are local variables(function scoped) and will not contain any datatypes since js is dynamically typed

function sum(a,b){
    console.log(a+b)
}
sum(5,3);

functions can even return the values using 'return' keyword
function sum(a,b){
   return a+b;
}
let res = sum(5,3);
console.log(res);

functions can have optional parameters with default value "undefined" when its argument is not passed when invoked
   function sum(a,b,c){
    console.log(a,b,c)
   }
   sum(5,3)
   Here a value is 5 , b value is 3 and c value is undefined

we can also make these undefined with some default values like
function sum(a,b,c=1){
    console.log(a,b,c)
   }
   sum(5,3)
   here c value will be 1 since it's not passed. it is called default parameters


Rest parameter: In case of more values are passed and need to accept them all, we use rest parameter. it is denoted by three dots . it is always the last in parameter's list. it accepts parameters in the form of array
  function sum(a,b,...c){
    console.log(a,b,c)
  }
  sum(5,6,7,8,9,10)
  Here a is 5 , b is 6, c is [7,8,9,10]

Spread Operator: 
   it is used to separate the array values/spread the array values. it is also denoted by three dots
   a = [5, 4], b = [3, 6]
c = [a, b]
console.log(c);  // [[5,4],[3,6]]
d = [...a, ...b]
console.log(d);  // [5,4,3,6]
let [e, ...f] = [5, 4, 3, 6];

Questions:
1. Write a function that checks whether give number is positive or negitive and prints it
2. Write a function that creates short code for everyname
for eg: short_code("Durga Prasad"). output: "DP"
3. Write a function that accepts any number of parameters and prints their product
4. Write a function to find factorial of given number
eg: fact(5) , output: 120


Functions can be defined in multiple ways in javascript
1. normal function declaration
   function sum(a,b){
    return a+b;
   }
2. function expression
   let sum = function(a,b){
    return a+b;
   }
3. arrow function (ES6 feature)
   let sum = (a,b) => {
    return a+b;
   }
if there is only one statement in arrow function body, we can skip the curly braces and return keyword
   let sum = (a,b) => a+b;
//convert below functions into function expressions and arrow functions
i. function mul(a,b){
   return a*b
}
const mul2 = function(a,b){
   return a*b
}
const mul3 = (a,b) => a*b
2. function area(r){
   return Math.PI*r*r*;
}
const area3 = function(r){return Math.PI*r*r*;}
const area2 = (r) =>Math.PI*r*r*;
3. function add(a){
   return function add2(b){
      return a+b
   }
}
const add1 = function(a){
   const add2 = function(b){
      return a*b
   }
   return add2
}

const add3 = (a) => (b)=> a*b;

callbacks : callback function is a function that is passed to another function as a parameter. The function that receives another function is called Higher Order Function
function_name(another_function_name);
eg: function mad ()
{
    console.log("it is mad")
}
function simple (a)
{
    console.log("it is simple")  
    a();
}
simple(mad)

callbacks can be used for asynchrnous Operations(any Operations that doesn't execute immediately)


closure : if one function nested in another function, the inner function remembers, the outer function value even after outer function execution ended is called closure
function Outer ()
{
    let x = 5;
    function inner ()
    {
        x++;
        console.log(x)
    }
    return inner;
}
let z = Outer();
z() //6
z() //7
