Arrays:Arrays are used to store a collection of elements.it stores each element with an index value(reference value). Always arrays index starts with 0
eg: let arr = [5,6,7,8]
 ----------------
 |5 | 6 | 7 | 8 |    ---> Elements
 ----------------
  0   1   2   3     ---> indexes 

  Arrays are mutable(operations on arrays might change the original array).
  Default methods in arrays are:
  length -- it is used to find the total elements in array
  arr.length; 
  if last index is 100, length will become 101.
  indexOf('ele')  -- returns the index of first occurance of given element
  lastIndexOf('ele') -- returns the index of last occurance of given element
  push(elements) -- it is used to add elements at the end of the array
  pop() -- it is used to remove the last element
  unshift(elements) -- it is used to add elements at the starting of the array
  shift() -- it is used to remove the starting element/first element
  splice(starting_index_number,deleteCount,inserting_elements) -- it starts from specific index and deletes based on count(or all if it is not present).also adds elements at specific index
  let friends = ["sheldon","ross","rachel","pheobe","chandler","penny"];
   ---  remove "penny" and add "monica"
   ---  remove "sheldon" and add "joey"
   ---  add "emma" between "ross" and "rachel"
friends.pop();friends.push("monica")
friends.shift();friends.unshift("joey")
friends.splice(2,0,"emma")

ForEach(callback) : it is used to iterate each and every element of the array and pass element and index to the callback function. ForEach is a void function so, it cannot return the values
   arrayName.ForEach(callback function(element,index){
      //body
   })

map(callback) :  it is also used similarly as forEach but it returns values for every element of given array
 arrayName.map(callback function(element,index){
      //body
   })

filter(callback): it is also used similar to map but it returns only the element with return condition 'true'
 arrayName.filter(callback function(element,index){
      //body
   })

includes : includes is used to check whether given element is existed in the array or not. if it is existed , it will return true else false
    let x = arr.includes("prasad")

find(callback) : it is used to check the first elements that satisfies the return condition and returns it
   Arrayname.find(function(ele,ind){
        //logic
     })
findIndex(callback): it is used to check the first elements that satisfies the return condition and returns the index
   Arrayname.findIndex(function(ele,ind){
        //logic
     })
some(callback) : it is used to check atleast one of the element satisfies the return condition and return true/false based on it.
   Arrayname.some(function(ele,ind){
        //logic
     })
Every(callback) : it is used to check whether every element of array satisfies the condition or not and return true/false based on it.
    Arrayname.Every(function(ele,ind){
        //logic
     })
sort(callback): sort is used to sort based alphabetical order but in case of number we can pass callback. it follows bubble sort kind of technique and it the callback returns negitive it moves forwards, else it swaps the elements and continues
    ascending order : arr.sort((a,b)=>a-b)
    descending order : arr.sort((a,b)=>b-a)
reduce(callback,initial_value):  reduce is used to apply accumulated logic such as adding or multiplying values with their previous one
     arr.reduce(function(prev,curr){
         //logic
      },initialvalue)
   
Questions:
let arr = [5,4,8,7,9,2,3]
  1. Print all the elements which are greater than 7 in given array. 
  2. Return and print only the elements which are odd in given array
  3. Write different ways to multiply all elements of array using foreach, map, reduce
  4. for given product prices array , give 20% discount to all products and return their new prices
      prices = [500,200,250,110,196];
