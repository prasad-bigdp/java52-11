Arrays:Arrays are used to store a collection of elements.it stores each element with an index value(reference value). Always arrays index starts with 0
eg: let arr = [5,6,7,8]
 ----------------
 |5 | 6 | 7 | 8 |    ---> Elements
 ----------------
  0   1   2   3     ---> indexes 

  Arrays are mutable(operations on arrays might change the original array).
  Default methods in arrays are:
  length -- it is used to find the total elements in array
  arr.length; 
  if last index is 100, length will become 101.
  indexOf('ele')  -- returns the index of first occurance of given element
  lastIndexOf('ele') -- returns the index of last occurance of given element
  push(elements) -- it is used to add elements at the end of the array
  pop() -- it is used to remove the last element
  unshift(elements) -- it is used to add elements at the starting of the array
  shift() -- it is used to remove the starting element/first element
  splice(starting_index_number,deleteCount,inserting_elements) -- it starts from specific index and deletes based on count(or all if it is not present).also adds elements at specific index
  let friends = ["sheldon","ross","rachel","pheobe","chandler","penny"];
   ---  remove "penny" and add "monica"
   ---  remove "sheldon" and add "joey"
   ---  add "emma" between "ross" and "rachel"
friends.pop();friends.push("monica")
friends.shift();friends.unshift("joey")
friends.splice(2,0,"emma")
