operators: These are used to perform operations on variables and values.
  - Arithmetic Operators: +, -, *, /, %,**
  let a = 2, b = 3;
let sum = a + b;
console.log(sum); //5
console.log(a - b, a * b, a / b, a % b, a ** b)

  -- Relational Operators: >,<,>=,<=,== ,===, !=,!==
  a = 2, b = '2';
console.log(a == b) //true
console.log(a === b) //false it also compares datatypes
console.log(a != b);// false
console.log(a !== b); //true
console.log(a>b,a<b,a>=b,a<=b)
   -- Logical Operators : &&, ||, !
   && -- true only if both statements are true
   || -- true when any one of the statement is true
   !  -- true when statement is false

   Assignment operators
    = , += ,-=,*=,/=,%= ,**=
    a+=2  ==> a = a+2;

    Increment and Decrement : These operators are used to increase or decrease the value by 1
     a = 5
     a++ 
     console.log(a)  //6
     a--
     console.log(a)   //5
     The increment or decremert have two variations i.e., Pre and Post

     Pre -- first updates the value and then assigns the value
     Post -- first assigns the value and then updates the value

     eg: a =5;
     let b = a++;
     console.log(b,a) //5 6

     Ternary operator: it is used to validate a condition and checks different values/statements based on condition(true/false)
     it uses three opeands so called ternary operator. it use symbols ? and  :
     let a = 5 ,b =10;
     let c = (a>b) ? "Good" : "Bad" ;
     console.log(c)

     Type casting : The conversion of one data type to another datatype is called Type casting. There are two types of typecasting such as
     i.implicit typecasting
     ii. Explicit typecasting


   i. implicit typecasting : it means types are converted automatically based on operations
      eg: 5 + '4' ===> '54'  (number is converted to string)
      5- ' 4' ===> 1  (string is converted to number)

   ii. explicit typecasting: it means types are converted by force using methods like tostring() or Wrappers like Number(),String(),Boolean() etcc.,
   '+' is also unary operator which is used to convert string to integer
      eg: 5 + +'4'  ==>9
      5 + Number('4')  ==> 9
